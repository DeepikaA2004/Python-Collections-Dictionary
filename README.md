# PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a string S. Write a function count_letters which will return a dictionary containing letters (including special characters) in string S as keys and their count in string S as values.

(Input and output will be handled by us you just need to write the function and return the dictionary)

## Input
The Joy of Computing

## Output
{'T': 1, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, ' ': 3, 'j': 1, 'o': 3, 'y': 1, 'f': 1, 'c': 1, 'm': 1, 'p': 1, 'u': 1, 't': 1, 'i': 1, 'n': 1, 'g': 1}

T has appeared once in the string, o has appeared 3 times in the string, and so on. (You do not have to worry about the order of arrangement in your dictionary)
